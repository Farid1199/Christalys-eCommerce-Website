# Chrystalis eCommerce Website
Welcome to the Christalis-eCommerce-Website repository. It contains the year-long team project for CS2TP module at Aston University. The following guide will cover general information about the projects, a user guide and instruction manual, project deployment across 3 different operating systems, and further information about the project. 

## Project Information 
Chrystalis is an eCommerce website that caters to a diverse audience, including bridal shoppers, gift seekers, and ethical consumers. The main objective of the project is to provide and sell jewellery, where users can explore rings, necklaces, bracelets, and earrings, adding favorites to their cart or wish list. The user-centric design of Chrystalis ensures easy navigation, accessible UI, and it meets the needs of different users with functionalities including search and filtering, user dashboard, product reviews, accessbility and account settings, and so on and so forth. The site also offers straightforward checkout, order tracking with receipt, and a wish list feature for saving products for later consideration. Customer support is accessible via business contact details and query form in the "Contact Us" page, whereas in the "About Us" page, customers can learn our story and objective, along with providing an overall review to the website via a query form, aimed at improving the website and meeting further requirements in the future. 

In addition, the website administrators can track user activity, inventory levels, and order statuses in real-time, by sending notifications and user logs to the admin panel. To further improve user engagement, the platform offers real-time alerts for the user, product and order process notifications using flash messages. Users can also add, update, and delete their accounts, whereas the admin can process users, products, and user orders in the same manner. All these features are achieved by using a clean interface and responsive design for access across devices.  

Our tech stack includes HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, Blade and Bootstrap for frontend development, whereas PHP in Laravel framework manages backend tasks, ensuring scalability. Additionally, we integrated Stripe for secure and efficient transaction processing, and Laravel Breeze for secure user registration, login and forgot password feature. For the admin panel, OpenAdmin framework has been utilised to organise our database functionalities and ensure seamless user, inventory and order management. 

## Website Deployment + Trello board 
The website has been deployed on the Aston universityâ€™s domain, whereas we successfully utilised Trello to allocate and manage tasks and roles.
